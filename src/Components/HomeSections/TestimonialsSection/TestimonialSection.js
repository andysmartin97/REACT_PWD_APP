                    <q>This water and their service provided me without a single problem 
                    in over a year before I moved to Arizona. The water is 
                    amazing. Flouride free and BPA free. The water dispenser 
                    makes it ice cold. I started drinking so much more water 
                    after I got mine. Thank you guys for the awesome service!</q>
